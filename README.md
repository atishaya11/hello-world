# hello-world
First github repository
This is my first github rrrepository. Just started learning about version control and how github uses the version control system git.
I generally program in java. 
Right now I am working on an android project.
Further I will be working with Bigdata as well.
Lerning basic python as well for understanding the mapper reducer codes.
